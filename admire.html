    The person I admire most is Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam who was Missile Man of India. He is popularly known as the People’s President of India.
    His full name was Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam. He was a great scientist and 11th President of India. <Br>
    He was born in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, in a poor Tamil Muslim family on 15th of October in 1931 to the
    Jainulabudeen and Ashiamma. He started supporting his family financially in his early age. He has completed his
    graduation from the St Joseph’s College, Tiruchirappalli in 1954 and Aerospace Engineering from the
    Madras Institute of Technology, Chennai in 1960.<br>
    He joined the DRDO (Defense Research and Development Organization) as a scientist where he designed a small helicopter for <br>
    the Indian Army. He also worked under Dr. Vikram Sarabhai as part of INCOSPAR committee. Later, he joined the Indian Space
    Research Organization (ISRO) in 1969 as project director of India’s first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III). Because of his great contributions for the development of ballistic missiles in India, he will be forever known as the “Missile Man of India”. The successful Pokhran-II nuclear tests of 1998 have also involved his important role. He has been the third President of India who awarded with the Bharat Ratna (first Dr. Sarvapali Radhakrishnan 1954 and second Dr. Zakir Hussain 1963). He has also been awarded with the Padma Bhushan in 1981 and Padma Vibhushan in 1990 for his contributions at ISRO and DRDO as well as the Government of India as a scientific advisor.
    He has written many books such as Wings of Fire, Ignited Minds, Target 3 Billion in 2011, Turning Points, India 2020, My Journey, etc.
